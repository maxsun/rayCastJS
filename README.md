# rayCastJS
###A first person ray-casting engine in pure Javascript!
----

You can try it out [here](https://maxsun.github.io/rayCastJS), or you can download the project and open "index.html" in any browser.

**rayCastJS** uses HTML5's canvas element to create 3d environments similar to those of old video games like Wolfenstein 3D.

For a great introduction to ray-casting, Jacob Seidelin's ["Creating Pseudo 3D Games with HTML 5 Canvas and Raycasting"](https://dev.opera.com/articles/3d-games-with-canvas-and-raycasting-part-1/) is great.
